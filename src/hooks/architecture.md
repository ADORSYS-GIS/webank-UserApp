Here’s a **detailed workflow** for your online banking application, broken down into the three entities: **User App (Frontend)**, **OBS (Backend Gateway/Authentication Layer)**, and **Bank Account Module (Backend Logic)**. Each step is explained with the responsibilities of each module.

---

### **1. Get Balance Workflow**

#### **Step 1: User App (Frontend)**

- **Action**: The user requests their account balance.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Construct an HTTP GET request to the `/api/accounts/{account_id}/balance` endpoint.
  - Include the user’s certificate (or JWT token) in the request headers for authentication.
  - Example request:
    ```http
    GET /api/accounts/12345/balance HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer <user_certificate_or_token>
    ```

---

#### **Step 2: OBS (Backend Gateway/Authentication Layer)**

- **Action**: Validate the request and forward it to the Bank Account Module.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Authenticate the user using the certificate or token.
  - Authorize the user to ensure they have access to the requested account.
  - If authentication and authorization succeed, forward the request to the Bank Account Module.
  - If authentication or authorization fails, return a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response.

---

#### **Step 3: Bank Account Module (Backend Logic)**

- **Action**: Retrieve the balance from the database and return it.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Query the database for the account balance using the `account_id`.
  - Example SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = '12345';
    ```
  - Return the balance to the OBS.
  - Example response:
    ```json
    {
      "account_id": "12345",
      "balance": 1000.5
    }
    ```

---

#### **Step 4: OBS (Backend Gateway/Authentication Layer)**

- **Action**: Return the balance to the User App.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Forward the response from the Bank Account Module to the User App.
  - Ensure the response is encrypted (HTTPS).

---

#### **Step 5: User App (Frontend)**

- **Action**: Display the balance to the user.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parse the JSON response and display the balance on the user interface.

---

### **2. View Transaction History Workflow**

#### **Step 1: User App (Frontend)**

- **Action**: The user requests their transaction history.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Construct an HTTP GET request to the `/api/accounts/{account_id}/transactions` endpoint.
  - Include the user’s certificate (or JWT token) in the request headers for authentication.
  - Example request:
    ```http
    GET /api/accounts/12345/transactions?page=1&page_size=10 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer <user_certificate_or_token>
    ```

---

#### **Step 2: OBS (Backend Gateway/Authentication Layer)**

- **Action**: Validate the request and forward it to the Bank Account Module.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Authenticate the user using the certificate or token.
  - Authorize the user to ensure they have access to the requested account.
  - If authentication and authorization succeed, forward the request to the Bank Account Module.
  - If authentication or authorization fails, return a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response.

---

#### **Step 3: Bank Account Module (Backend Logic)**

- **Action**: Retrieve the transaction history from the database and return it.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Query the database for the transaction history using the `account_id`.
  - Example SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM transactions
    WHERE from_account_id = '12345' OR to_account_id = '12345'
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
    LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
    ```
  - Return the transaction history to the OBS.
  - Example response:
    ```json
    {
      "account_id": "12345",
      "transactions": [
        {
          "transaction_id": "67890",
          "from_account_id": "12345",
          "to_account_id": "54321",
          "amount": 100.0,
          "transaction_type": "transfer",
          "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:34:56Z",
          "status": "completed"
        }
      ],
      "pagination": {
        "page": 1,
        "page_size": 10,
        "total_records": 50
      }
    }
    ```

---

#### **Step 4: OBS (Backend Gateway/Authentication Layer)**

- **Action**: Return the transaction history to the User App.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Forward the response from the Bank Account Module to the User App.
  - Ensure the response is encrypted (HTTPS).

---

#### **Step 5: User App (Frontend)**

- **Action**: Display the transaction history to the user.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parse the JSON response and display the transaction history on the user interface.
  - Implement pagination to allow the user to navigate through the transaction history.

---

### **3. Mock Transaction Workflow (Optional)**

#### **Step 1: Bank Account Module (Backend Logic)**

- **Action**: Create a mock transaction for testing purposes.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Insert a mock transaction into the `transactions` table.
  - Example SQL query:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, from_account_id, to_account_id, amount, transaction_type, timestamp, status)
    VALUES ('mock123', '12345', '54321', 100.00, 'transfer', NOW(), 'completed');
    ```

---

#### **Step 2: Bank Account Module (Backend Logic)**

- **Action**: Update the account balances for the mock transaction.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Deduct the amount from the `from_account_id` balance.
  - Add the amount to the `to_account_id` balance.
  - Example SQL queries:
    ```sql
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE account_id = '12345';
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE account_id = '54321';
    ```

This version of the workflow focuses on **mocking transactions** instead of interacting with a real database. It ensures that you can test and develop the application without needing a fully functional database. Let me know if you need further clarification!
